# Student Record Management System

A simple yet effective console-based application developed in Python to manage student records. This project allows users to add, view, search, and delete student data such as Name, Roll Number, Department, and Marks as well as all stored in a persistent text file.

# Project Objective

To build a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts such as:
- File handling
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic data structures (strings, lists)

This project is ideal for beginners in Python who want to practice handling real-world user input and file storage operations.


# Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, you will:
- Understand how to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system
- Gain hands-on experience with file operations in Python
- Learn to write modular and maintainable code
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills


# Use Cases

This system can be adapted for:
- School or college mini-projects
- Local student record tracking
- Entry-level internship demonstrations
- A portfolio project for resume or GitHub


# Features

- Add new student records  
- View all stored records  
- Search a student by roll number  
- Delete a studentâ€™s record  
- Records stored persistently in a `.txt` file
